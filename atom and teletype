## Mac

Installing Atom from the UHC AppStore gives you a super out of date version (19 versions old) that is not compatible with Teletype.
But it can be installed and run just using a web browser. It does not require admin privileges to run, so it does not violate any security policy installed onto the computers.

Atom can be installed from the following link in Safari: https://atom.io
The current version is 1.27.2 and it is for macOS 10.9 or later. Click the download button to begin the installation.
Once Atom is properly installed, launch the application.

Now we will install Teletype. To do this, go to the following link in Safari: atom://settings-view/show-package?package=teletype
This should prompt you to "allow this page to open Atom" and click allow. You should be redirected to Settings > Packages > Teletype.
Then click install under teletype.

## Windows

Follow the same instruction above, except use Google Chrome as your browser when opening the links.

# Known Issues

These are some common issues that we had a lot.

## Mac

Sometimes, when using teletype, Mac computers cannot connect to teletype servers.
It will either just take a while, or it will give some error messages in the top right of the screen.
This is an issue with the security preferences on the computers we were given, in order to allow teletype to connect to the network, open safari, and search for anything.
It can be random letters, it doesn't matter, it just needs to make any connection with the outside world, then teletype will know its ok.

When sending the portal link, you cannot just use command+c to copy, you need to hit the copy button.

## Windows

# How to Use Teletype

So in the bottom right corner there will be a little broadcasting tower symbol. Click on that and it will prompt you to sign in with github. Sign in using the provided link. Once you sign in and authorize teletype with github, you can begin using teletype. To start sharing a file, open it, click on the teletype symbol in the bottom right of the screen, and click the little share switch. This will then generate a link, click the "copy" button to copy it (do NOT just use your keyboards copy function). Then send that link to whoever you want to share it with. To join, click the teletype icon, click the "join a portal" button and type the link in and click join.
